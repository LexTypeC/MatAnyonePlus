# MatAnyonePlus

A pinokio script for my own slightly tweaked verison of https://github.com/pq-yang/MatAnyone.git

Main additions are bidirectional matting allowing using a frame in the middle of a video as a reference frame as well as automated background reconstruction by averaging out masked regions of frames.
